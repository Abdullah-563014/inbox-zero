# TipTap Rules Editor Implementation Summary

## What Was Built

I've created a comprehensive TipTap-based rules editor with custom nodes for Rules and Context. The implementation includes:

### Components Created

1. **Custom TipTap Nodes**

   - `RuleNode` - For creating rules with AI-generated metadata
   - `ContextNode` - For adding context information

2. **UI Components**

   - `RuleNodeView` - Renders rule nodes with expand/collapse functionality
   - `ContextNodeView` - Renders context nodes with simple text display
   - `SlashCommandList` - Dropdown menu for slash commands
   - `RulesEditor` - Main editor component with toolbar and save logic

3. **Extensions**

   - `SlashCommands` - Enables `/rule` and `/context` commands

4. **Example Integration**
   - `RulesEditorPage` - Shows how to integrate with existing AI functionality
   - `example-usage.tsx` - Simple example with mock functions

### Key Features

1. **Visual Design**

   - Rules: Green border/background with lightning bolt icon
   - Context: Blue border/background with book icon
   - Hover states show expand and delete buttons

2. **Slash Commands**

   - Type `/` to open command menu
   - Quick insertion of Rule and Context nodes

3. **AI Integration**

   - Rules without metadata show placeholder text
   - On save, AI generates rule name and actions
   - Once generated, metadata is preserved and editable

4. **Metadata Management**

   - Expandable view for rule metadata
   - Edit rule names and actions
   - Add/remove actions dynamically
   - Support for all action types (Label, Archive, Draft, etc.)

5. **Save Flow**
   - Processes all rules without metadata
   - Shows loading state during AI generation
   - Saves complete document with metadata

## Installation

The required dependencies have been installed:

```bash
@tiptap/suggestion
tippy.js
```

## Integration with Existing Code

The `RulesEditorPage` component shows how to integrate with your existing infrastructure:

- Uses `aiCreateRule` for AI metadata generation
- Integrates with `actionClient` for server actions
- Uses existing authentication via `useAccount`
- Follows your error handling patterns

## Next Steps

To fully integrate this into your application:

1. **Database Schema**: Add fields to store rules documents (e.g., in EmailAccount model)
2. **Routes**: Create a route for the rules editor page
3. **Navigation**: Add links to access the rules editor
4. **Permissions**: Ensure proper authentication and authorization

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { RulesEditorPage } from "@/components/rules-editor/RulesEditorPage";

// In your page component
export default function RulesEditorRoute() {
  return <RulesEditorPage />;
}
```

The editor provides a clean, document-style interface where users can:

1. Write rules in natural language
2. Add context about their preferences
3. Let AI generate appropriate actions
4. Review and customize the generated metadata
5. Save everything as a structured document
